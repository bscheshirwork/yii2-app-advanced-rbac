Using advanced project template at shared hosting
=================================================

Deploying an advanced project template to shared hosting is a bit trickier than a basic one because it has two webroots,
which shared hosting webservers don't support. We will need to adjust the directory structure so frontend URL will be
`http://site.test` and backend URL will be `http://site.test/admin`.

### Move entry scripts into single webroot

First of all we need a webroot directory. Create a new directory and name it to match your hosting webroot name,
e.g., `www` or `public_html` or the like. Then create the
following structure where `www` is the hosting webroot directory you just created:

```
www
    admin
backend
common
console
environments
frontend
...
```

`www` will be our frontend directory so move the contents of `frontend/web` into it. Move the contents of `backend/web`
into `www/admin`. In each case you will need to adjust the paths in `index.php` and `index-test.php`.

### Adjust sessions and cookies

Originally the backend and frontend are intended to run at different domains. When weâ€™re moving it all to the same domain
the frontend and backend will be sharing the same cookies, creating a clash. In order to fix it, adjust backend application config
`backend/config/main.php` as follows:

```php
'components' => [
    'request' => [
        'csrfParam' => '_csrf-backend',
        'csrfCookie' => [
            'httpOnly' => true,
            'path' => '/admin',
        ],
    ],
    'user' => [
        'identityClass' => 'common\models\User',
        'enableAutoLogin' => true,
        'identityCookie' => [
            'name' => '_identity-backend',
            'path' => '/admin',
            'httpOnly' => true,
        ],
    ],
    'session' => [
        // this is the name of the session cookie used for login on the backend
        'name' => 'advanced-backend',
        'cookieParams' => [
            'path' => '/admin',
        ],
    ],
],
```
